  Algorithmic trading, also called algo trading and black box trading,
  encompasses trading systems that are heavily reliant on complex mathematical
  formulas and high-speed, computer programs to determine trading strategies.
  These strategies use electronic platforms to enter trading orders with an
  algorithm which executes pre-programmed trading instructions accounting for a
  variety of variables such as timing, price, and volume.
